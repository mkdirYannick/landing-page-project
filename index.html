            <div class="small_text">In this picture, Hercules is offered a choice between Vice on the right, a life of meaningless pleasures,
                and Virtue on the left, a life of hardship and honour. Just like Hercules, we are confronted with this choice everyday.
                We shall choose our path wisely.

             In other words, man is ultimately self-determining. Man does not simply exist but always decides what his existence will be, what he will become in the next moment.
              By the same token, every human being has the freedom to change at any instant.”
